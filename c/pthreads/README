This is a pthreads-based implementation with a pool of worker threads fed by a
rather silly thread-safe queue thingy. On Apple platforms it will use
the CommonCrypto framework for SHA2 hashing, and on non-Apple platforms it
should use the included sha2.c implementation by Oliver Gay:

I haven't actually tried building it on Linux, so it might be broken there, but
should be relatively straightforward to port.
